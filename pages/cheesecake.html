        <p>Cheesecake is a sweet dessert consisting of one or more layers. The main, and thickest, 
            layer consists of a mixture of a soft, fresh cheese, eggs, and sugar. 
            If there is a bottom layer, it most often consists of a crust or base made from crushed cookies, g
            raham crackers, pastry, or sometimes sponge cake.</p>
